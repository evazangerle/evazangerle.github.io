* I just joined the programme committee for WSDM 2023 [06/2022].  
* Happy to announce that our workshop proposal was accepted at RecSys 2022. Very much looking forward to the second
  edition of the [Perspectives workshop](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2022/), together with Christine Bauer and
Alan Said [04/2022].
* Our paper [Height Optimized Tries](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3506692) has just appeared in ACM Transactions on Database Systems (CORE A\*, together with Robert Binna, Martin Pichl, Viktor Leis, and Günther Specht) [04/2022].
* Our paper [Overview of PAN 2022: Authorship Verification, Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders, Style Change
  Detection, and Trigger Detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-99739-7_42) as part of the
proceedings of the 44th European Conference on IR Research (ECIR 2022) [04/2022].  
* Our event report on the [Perspectives workshop at ACM RecSys 2021](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2021/) has just appeared in [SIGIR Forum](https://sigir.org/forum/issues/december-2021/) [02/2022].
* I've just joined the program committee of SIGIR 2022 [01/2022].
* Happy to announce that our paper "Height Optimized Tries" has been accepted for [ACM Transactions on Database Systems](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tods).
  This joint work with Robert Binna, Martin Pichl, Viktor Leis, and Günther Specht is an extended version of our [SIGMOD paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3196896) "HOT: A Height Optimized Trie Index for Main-Memory Database Systems"  [12/2021].
* Happy to serve as track chair for UMAP (Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization) 2022 (Personalized Recommender Systems) and for ACM Hypertext 2022 (Adaptive Web and Recommender Systems), together with Osnat Mokryn and Markus Zanker [11/2021].
* Our paper "Novel Datasets for Evaluating Song Popularity Prediction Tasks" has been accepted at the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM) [10/2021].
* The proceedings of our [Perspectives Workshop](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2021/) are out: [Ceur WS Vol 2955](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2955/), find the teaser videos for the papers [here](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2021/videos/) [09/2021].
* I'm presenting an overview of our Style Change Detection task as part of [PAN@CLEF2021](https://pan.webis.de/clef21/pan21-web/index.html) on September, 23rd. Have a look at our overview paper and participant's papers in the [CLEF working notes at ceur-ws](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/) [09/2021].
* Our project "Humans and Recommender Systems: Towards a Mutual Understanding" has now officially started, find the
  project's website <a href="http://humrec.github.io">here</a> [09/2021].
* Newly joined the program committees of ECIR 2022 (44th European
Conference on Information Retrieval) and TheWebConf 2022 (The Web
Conference 2022) [09/2021].
* Our article "User models for multi-context-aware music recommendation" just appeared in Springer Multimedia Tools and
  Applications. Find the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09890-7">here</a> [05/2021].<br>
* My project proposal "Humans and Recommender Systems: Towards a Mutual Understanding" was approved by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (grant awarded: 599k EUR). I'm looking forward to enhancing the understanding of human decision-making underlying the choice of certain music in a given situational context and advancing the users' understanding for the decisions that lead to the recommendation of certain (sequences of) tracks. The thereby increased understanding and communication between users and the system can contribute to improved user models and, thus, recommendation performance. A previously largely unexplored aspect will be the development of techniques for sequential recommendation strongly targeted at giving explanations for these sequences and considering user feedback. <br>
