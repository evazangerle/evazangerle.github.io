* Our article "User models for multi-context-aware music recommendation" just appeared in Springer Multimedia Tools and
  Applications. Find the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09890-7">here</a> [05/2021].<br>
* My project proposal "Humans and Recommender Systems: Towards a Mutual Understanding" was approved by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (grant awarded: 599k EUR). I'm looking forward to enhancing the understanding of human decision-making underlying the choice of certain music in a given situational context and advancing the users' understanding for the decisions that lead to the recommendation of certain (sequences of) tracks. The thereby increased understanding and communication between users and the system can contribute to improved user models and, thus, recommendation performance. A previously largely unexplored aspect will be the development of techniques for sequential recommendation strongly targeted at giving explanations for these sequences and considering user feedback. <br>

* Our [new study](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00268-9) published in EPJ Data Science shows that music recommendations for fans of beyond-mainstream music, such as hard rock and ambient, may receive be less accurate recommendations than for fans of mainstream music, such as pop. We investigated the effects of popularity bias in music recommender systems for listeners of non-mainstream-listeners. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing improved user models and recommendation approaches to better serve beyond-mainstream music listeners. 
Our findings have also been covered by press, among others, by the Austrian newspaper [derStandard](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000125459611/musik-algorithmen-tun-sich-mit-hardrockern-und-hiphop-hoerern-schwer), [Rolling Stone Italia](https://www.rollingstone.it/musica/ecco-perche-lalgoritmo-delle-app-di-streaming-non-indovina-i-tuoi-gusti-musicali/556644/), [BioMedCentral](https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-physicalsciences/2021/04/13/algorithm-generated-music-recommendations-low-accuracy-for-fans-of-beyond-mainstream-music/), or a [blog by the University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/tu-graz/services/news-stories/tu-graz-news/einzelansicht/article/algorithmus-basierte-musikempfehlungen-geringe-treffsicherheit-fuer-liebhaber-von-nicht-mainstream-m/).
