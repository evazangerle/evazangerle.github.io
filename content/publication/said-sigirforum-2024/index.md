abstract: 'Evaluation is a central step when developing, optimizing, and deploying
  recommender systems. The PERSPECTIVES 2023 workshop, held as part of the 17th ACM
  Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2023), served as a forum where researchers
  from both academia and industry critically reflected on the evaluation of recommender
  systems. The goal of the PERSPECTIVES workshop series is to capture the current
  state of evaluation from different perspectives and discuss the different targets
  that recommender systems evaluation should strive for. In the third edition of the
  workshop, we discussed problems and lessons learned, and aimed to move the discourse
  forward within the community.Date: 19 September 2023.Website: https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2023/.'
