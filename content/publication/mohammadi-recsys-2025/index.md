abstract: Explainability in recommender systems&nbsp;(RS) remains a pivotal yet challenging
  research frontier. Among state-of-the-art techniques, counterfactual explanations
  stand out for their effectiveness, as they show how small changes to input data
  can alter recommendations, providing actionable insights that build user trust and
  enhance transparency. Despite their growing prominence, the evaluation of counterfactual
  explanations in RS is far from standardized. Specifically, existing metrics show
  inconsistency since they are affected by variations in the performance of the underlying
  recommenders. Hence, we critically examine the evaluation of counterfactual explainers
  through consistency as the key principle of effective evaluation. Through extensive
  experiments, we assess how going beyond top-1 recommendation and incorporating top-k
  recommendations impacts the consistency of existing evaluation metrics. Our findings
  reveal factors that impact the consistency of existing evaluation metrics and offer
  a step toward effectively mitigating the inconsistency problem in counterfactual
  explanation evaluation.
