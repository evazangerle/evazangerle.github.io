abstract: 'The paper gives a brief overview of three shared tasks which have been
  organized at the PAN 2023 lab on digital text forensics and stylometry hosted at
  the CLEF 2023 conference. The tasks include authorship verification across discourse
  types, multi-author writing style analysis, profiling cryptocurrency influencers
  with few-shot learning, and trigger detection. Authorship verification and multi-author
  analysis continue and advance from past editions of PAN and influencer profiling
  and trigger detection are new tasks with novel research questions and evaluation
  resources. All four tasks alilgn with the goals of all shared tasks at PAN: to advance
  the state of the art in text forensics and stylometry while ensuring objective evaluation
  on newly developed benchmark datasets.'
