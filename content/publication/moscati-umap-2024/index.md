abstract: Emotions constitute an important aspect when listening to music. While manual
  annotations from user studies grounded in psychological research on music and emotions
  provide a well-defined and fine-grained description of the emotions evoked when
  listening to a music track, user-generated tags provide an alternative view stemming
  from large-scale data. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two
  emotional characterizations of music and analyze their impact on the performance
  of emotion-based music recommender systems individually and jointly. Our analysis
  shows that (i) the agreement between the two characterizations, as measured with
  Cohen’s κ coefficient and Kendall rank correlation, is often low, (ii) Leveraging
  the emotion profile based on the intensity of evoked emotions from high-quality
  annotations leads to performances that are stable across different recommendation
  algorithms; (iii) Simultaneously leveraging the emotion profiles based on high-quality
  and large-scale annotations allows to provide recommendations that are less exposed
  to the low accuracy that algorithms might reach when leveraging one type of data,
  only.
