 abstract = {In sequential recommendation scenarios, user intent is a key driver of consumption behavior. However, consumption intents are usually latent and hence, difficult to leverage for recommender systems. Additionally, intents can be of repeated nature (e.g. yearly shopping for christmas gifts or buying a new phone), which has not been exploited by previous approaches. To navigate these impediments we propose the HyperHawkes model which models user sessions via hypergraphs and extracts user intents via contrastive clustering. We use Hawkes Processes to model the temporal dynamics of intents, namely repeated consumption patterns and long-term interests of users. For short-term interest adaption, which is more fine-grained than intent-level modeling, we use a multi-level attention mixture network and fuse long-term and short-term signals. We use the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) framework for training the model by alternating between intent representation learning and optimizing parameters of the long- and short-term modules. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets from different domains show that HyperHawkes significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},
