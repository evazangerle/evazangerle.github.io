abstract: The paper gives a brief overview of the four shared tasks to be organized
  at the PAN 2022 lab on digital text forensics and stylometry hosted at the CLEF
  2022 conference. The tasks include authorship verification across discourse types,
  multi-author writing style analysis, author profiling, and content profiling. Some
  of the tasks continue and advance past editions (authorship verification and multi-author
  analysis) and some are new (profiling irony and stereotypes spreaders and trigger
  detection). The general goal of the PAN shared tasks is to advance the state of
  the art in text forensics and stylometry while ensuring objective evaluation on
  newly developed benchmark datasets.
