abstract: 'The comprehensive evaluation of the performance of a recommender system
  is a complex endeavor: many facets need to be considered in configuring an adequate
  and effective evaluation setting. Such facets include, for instance, defining the
  specific goals of the evaluation, choosing an evaluation method, underlying data,
  and suitable evaluation metrics. In this paper, we consolidate and systematically
  organize this dispersed knowledge on recommender systems evaluation. We introduce
  the “Framework for EValuating Recommender systems” (FEVR) that we derive from the
  discourse on recommender systems evaluation. In FEVR, we categorize the evaluation
  space of recommender systems evaluation. We postulate that the comprehensive evaluation
  of a recommender system frequently requires considering multiple facets and perspectives
  in the evaluation. The FEVR framework provides a structured foundation to adopt
  adequate evaluation configurations that encompass this required multi-facettedness
  and provides the basis to advance in the field. We outline and discuss the challenges
  of a comprehensive evaluation of recommender systems, and provide an outlook on
  what we need to embrace and do to move forward as a research community.'
