abstract: This workshop challenges the machine learning-centric focus of modern recommender
  systems research by reconnecting the field with its interdisciplinary origins and
  exploring the non-algorithmic dimensions that are crucial to effective recommendation.
  It fosters a space for reflective, critical, and creative discussions on recommender
  systems that embrace human values, user experiences, and societal impact. The workshop
  emphasizes methodological diversity and invites contributions from psychology, human-computer
  interaction, ethics, design, and other disciplines.
