The tasks include authorship verification across discourse types, multi-author writing style analysis, profiling cryptocurrency influencers with few-shot learning, and trigger detection. Authorship verification and multi-author analysis continue and advance from past editions of PAN and influencer profiling and trigger detection are new tasks with novel research questions and evaluation resources. All four tasks alilgn with the goals of all shared tasks at PAN: to advance the state of the art in text forensics and stylometry while ensuring objective evaluation on newly developed benchmark datasets.},
