 abstract = {The paper gives a brief overview of the four shared tasks to be organized at the PAN 2022 lab on digital text forensics and stylometry hosted at the CLEF 2022 conference. The tasks include authorship verification across discourse types, multi-author writing style analysis, author profiling, and content profiling. Some of the tasks continue and advance past editions (authorship verification and multi-author analysis) and some are new (profiling irony and stereotypes spreaders and trigger detection). The general goal of the PAN shared tasks is to advance the state of the art in text forensics and stylometry while ensuring objective evaluation on newly developed benchmark datasets.},
